1.7.7 2013-03-18

- Added inline js to fg_base_viewp3.cpt to disable Plone 4.3's non-kss
  inline validation for Archetypes. Note that this depends on a fix pushed
  to 4.3.x after 4.3rc1. Without that fix, inline validation will be
  attempted anyway; it's invisible except for log entries.

  with Plone 4.3.
  [lewicki]

- types with spaces in their ids should work with quickedit

----------------

  a move cursor.
  [smcmahon]

  affect several other error strings. Thanks, sunew!

  after submitting form whith not all required fields provided."
  Thanks, ksuess!

- Partially Fixed issue #18 (new, github tracker): "BadRequest after
  adding a new thanks page if link integrity checking is enabled" by
  removing link from default nosubmit message. A fix that will allow
  importing, cutting and pasting of old versions will need work. Thanks,
  datakurre!

  [fRiSi]

  placeholder. Fixed.

  1.6. Stripped all the "not HAS_PLONE30" code.
  [stevem]

- Get validator.js from plone.app.jquerytools. This requires plone.app.jquerytools>=1.2dev.
  1.2dev is available as p.a.jqt's svn trunk at this moment.
  [stevem]

- Move some of the .js and .css resources into a browser resource directory

  from restricted Python (so they can be used in templates).
  [davisagli]

- Make sure the fgTDefault expression gets evaluated with the field object
  as its expression context object when the field is viewed directly.
  (The field object is used when evaluating fgTDefault when viewing the entire
  form, but the form object was previously used when evaluating it when viewing
  the field, which was a problematic inconsistency.)
  [davisagli]

1.6.0
-----

  browser view permission in another package.
  [naro]

- Avoid deprecation warnings for InitializeClass in Plone 4.
  [hannosch]

  [hannosch]

- Switch to a more realistic request for the functional tests to avoid
  translation errors during validation in p4.
  [stevem]

  [maurits]

  [toutpt]

- Clean up quick edit visuals; make the drag and drop look like Plone 4.
  [stevem]

- Quick Edit reload after delete or other change wasn't working (at least in
  firefox) as the browser wasn't reloading if there was a hash tag.

  migrate storage to LOBTree introduced in 1.6.0b4

  [vangheem]

- Add form tracking plugin for collective.googleanalytics. (Matt Yoder)

  [seletz]

  Plone 4. (David Glick)

- Use an LOBTree to store results in the saved data adapter when available
  (i.e. with ZODB>=3.8.x), allowing us to stop keeping track of the result
  count in the _inputItems attribute, thereby greatly reducing the number of
  write conflicts under load. (David Glick)


1.6.0b2
-------

- Adjust ScriptableFields version requirements.

1.6.0b1
-------

 - Accept Canadian postal codes with lowercase letters. (David Glick)

 - Fix issue where the saved data adapter did not save data when using an
   embedded form whose action on success is to traverse to another page.
   (Thomas Buchberger, David Glick)

 - Plone 4 Compatibility.

 - Save Data Adapter now checks for existence of LinguaPlone canonical
   language form's adapter before trying to use it.
   Thanks, Jean-Pascal Houde. Fixes #270.

1.5.5
-----

- Add infrastructure for upgrade steps for the GenericSetup profile.
  (David Glick)

1.5.4
-----

 - Restoring tests to the distribution restored the Windows install problem.
   Yuck. Reverted deletion of MANIFEST.in. Those needing to run the tests
   should check out PFG from svn. (Steve)

1.5.3
-----

 - Don't try to get the recipient e-mail from the owner of the form folder if
   the user no longer exists. (David Glick)

 - Add a 'show_text' option for fg_embedded_view_p3 which causes the prologue
   and epilogue to be displayed. (David Glick)

   (SteveM)

1.5.2
-----

 - Fix for #262, File Field does not send attachment.
   (David Glick; thanks, Melnychuk Taras)

 - Fix for #261, PFG misbehaves on hidden fields.
   (Thanks, Ralf Hemmecke)

 - Changed the wording of the postal code validator to say "postal code"
   instead of "zip code," since the former is understandable in both the US and
   Canada. (David Glick)

1.5.1
-----

 - Adjusted the isZipCode string validator to also accept Canadian postal
   codes. (David Glick)

 - Fixed embedded forms so that traversal to a thank you page works properly
   with VirtualHostMonster URLs. (David Glick)

 - The mail adapter field selection wasn't working with attachments.
   (Fixes #256, thanks Angela Wong)

1.5.0
------

   the switch to GS. (Fixes #252, thanks Matthew Sital-Singh)

 - Fixed fieldset settings 'Show Title as Legend'
   (Radim Novotny)

 - Boolean (checkbox) required field behavior was not as advertised. Probably due
   to a change in archetypes at some point. Making a checkbox required will now do
   nothing but show the required indicator. (Fixes #202, thanks Dylan Jay)

1.5rc2
------

 - Pruned tests directory from the Python Package. Installation had been failing
   on some Windows machines while copying the deeply nested tests. We're guessing
   that path length restrictions were exceeded. Those needing to run the tests
   should check out PFG from svn. (Steve)

 - Factored action adapter processing out of the fgvalidate method of the form
   folder, and added a 'skip_action_adapters' parameter to fgvalidate (default:
   False), so it's possible to validate without calling the action adapters, or
   vice versa. (David Glick)

1.5rc1
------

 - Add "action" to form tags for quick editor to be more XHTML compliant.
   (Thanks: jonstahl, #248)

   duplicating an adapter that is already activated. (Fixes #247)

   .zexp or schemas are recreated. (Fixes #218; Thanks Marie Robichon)

 - Added warning on startup if PFGCaptchaField is still installed.
   (David Glick)

 - The captcha field edit should not show default, length ...
   fields that are not relevant. (Steve)

 - If mail adapter received a UTF-8 subject where it expected unicode,
   a unicode decode error would result. Fixed. (Thanks, javimansilla)
   (merge from 1.2-Maintenance branch)

 - Corrected URL for audio captcha icon. (David Glick)

 - Added the CHANGES.txt to the long_description so that it show up on
   pypi, Hello World!  Also cleaned up the reST so that it will render
   properly (claytron)

1.5b5
-----

 - Fix bad eggification of 1.5b4.

1.5b4
-----

 - Changed a few field titles to friendlier names: boolean -> checkbox,
   integer -> whole number, fixed-point -> decimal number. (Steve McMahon)

 - Merged branches/davisagli-captcha, providing a CAPTCHA field utilizing
   either collective.captcha or collective.recaptcha. (Thanks, David Glick!)

 - Reworked install strategy for allowed content types for form folders and
   fieldsets to determine what's allowed by interfaces rather than GS profile.
   This makes it much easier to add fields, adapters and thanks pages from
   outside. (Steve McMahon)

 - Fixed a problem with boolean fields in later Zope/Archetypes. (Tracker
   #244)

 - QuickEdit got mixed up with fields that themselves contain
   tables. Fixed. (Steve McMahon)

 - When using Zope 2.9.10 and Plone 2.5.x, form validation would produce an
   Unauthorized error in fgvalidate_base. Fixed.
   (Tracker #233; Thanks, Jean-Pascal Houde)

 - Moved PFGDataGrid from examples/ to be a separate product.
   (Steve McMahon)

 - Make uninstall work cleanly even if Kupu has bad linkable types.
   (Steve McMahon)

 - Make the mailer subject variable substitution use the same method as for
   the other fields so it's easier to override. (David Glick)

 - Prevent embedded forms from hijacking the portal status messages unless the
   form was actually submitted. (David Glick)

 - Add hooks for configuring form unload protection and auto-focus, and disable
   them for embedded forms by default. (David Glick)

 - Fixed issue where submission of an embedded PFG form could cause processing
   of a standalone PFG form later in the page. (David Glick)

 - Fixed issue with embedded forms where the form would get processed again
   after a Retry if the form was also embedded on the thank you page. (David
   Glick)

 - Patched plone.app.portlets to not catch the Retry exception, which was
   causing problems when submitting forms embedded in portlets. (David Glick)

 - Fixed the link spam validator for text fields, which wasn't working
   properly.  (David Glick)

 - Merged CAPTCHA field implementation from PFGCaptchaField (thanks Thomas
   Buchberger), and added collective.recaptcha as a dependency.
   collective.captcha will be used instead if it is present in the Python
   environment.
   (David Glick)

 - Fixed check for CSRF protection support, so that PFG doesn't break on
   Plone 3.0 if PloneHotfixCVE20080164 isn't installed. (David Glick)

 - Creating a new data saver could under obscure circumstances cause an
   exception "AttributeError: SavedFormInput" in some old compatibility code.
   Removed the offending code. (Steve McMahon)

 - Add some protection against trying to save old, unusable content types
   back to kupu's linkable's resource. (Steve McMahon)

 - guess_content_type, used in htmlValue in the file field, needs the same
   import protection used in the save data adapter, or it will fail in
   later Zopes. (Thanks, Tom Gross)

1.5b2
-----

 - Support for export/import of PloneFormGen form folders via generic setup
   profiles and the portal_setup tool as well as contextual form (i.e. on an
   individual form basis) export/import. Feature aimed at improving the
   development capabilities of PloneFormGen and simplifying the lives of
   integrators. Feature considered experimental.  Use with care and test
   thoroughly. (Andrew Burkhalter)

 - Make sure server-side only fields can supply a value via the default override.
   (David Glick)

 - Don't break old forms that are missing some of the new fields. (David Glick)

 - Add quick edit mode for forms. (Steve McMahon)

1.5b1
-----

 - Added 'Server-Side Variable' override so that you can make an expression
   available to action adapters without passing it in a hidden field.
   (Fulvio Casali, Alex Tokar, David Glick)

 - Add ${key} style substitution from form dictionary
   for mailer subject, prologue, epilogue and footer. Also,
   ThanksPage prologue and epilogue. (Steve McMahon)

 - Add CSRF protection option (on by default). [Plone 3 only] (Steve McMahon)

 - Added support for choosing an alternate csv text delimiter for Save Data
   Adapters. (Jesse Snyder)

 - Adapters are now activated when pasted into form folders. (Jesse Snyder)

 - Added 'force SSL' option for form folders. (David Glick)

 - Removed validator from the form action override field. This allows
   relative urls in the override. (Michael Dunlap)

 - Add Bcc override for mailer. (Steve McMahon)

 - Validator for multiple comma separated email addresses is now an
   option for string fields. (Paul Bugni)

 - Added "Include Empties" flag to mailer. On by default. Similar to
   thanks page. (Steve McMahon)

 - Wrap rendered rich label fields in div with selectors similar to
   other Archetypes widgets. (Steve McMahon)

 - The default view of all form fields is now base_edit. There's a
   UI problem left that the "view" tab is selected on initial jump
   into the field even though you're seeing the edit view.
   (Steve McMahon)

 - Link spam prevention is now an option for string and text fields.
   (Jon Baldivieso)

 - Allow use of any string field for mailer recipient choice. A bit
   scary until we get captchas built in. (Steve McMahon)

 - Mailer now has an option to select among available fields those
   which should be included in the e-mail. Interface is identical to
   thanks page. (Steve McMahon)

 - Added support for embedding PFG forms into other templates.  See
   README_EMBEDDING.txt for details. [Plone 3 only] (David Glick)

 - Clean out 2.1 compatibility code. Ahhhh! (Steve McMahon)

 - Pulling out removeSkinLayer for arg PloneFormGenPlone3, since
   this appears to have not existed and certainly is unnecessary
   currently (Andrew Burkhalter)

 - Removed unneeded and unused legacy typesonly profile directory
   (Andrew Burkhalter)

 - Installation process is entirely based upon GenericSetup extension
   profiles to the level that is pragmatic for support of Plone 2.5.x
   up to version Plone 3.x. In brief, this means that we have an install
   method so that we appear installable with the portal_quickinstaller
   tool in Plone 2.5.x and that we run relevant profiles in portal_setup
   upon install (Jesse Snyder, Andrew Burkhalter)

1.2.5
-----

 - Integrate Portugese translation from Nuno Cruz.

 - Form submission should not be disabled when the form is locked for
   editing.

 - Fixed bug where 3rd-party additions to the list of types allowed
   within a form folder were purged on PFG reinstall.
   This closes http://plone.org/products/ploneformgen/issues/210
   (David Glick)

 - Fixed bug where install failed if portal_factory still references
   any types that no longer exist in portal_types.
   (David Glick)

1.2.4
-----

 - Added Rating-Scale Field based on Titus Anderson's LikertField.
   Thanks to Titus and the University of Louisville.

 - Add delete capabilities to Andreas' record editor. Added escaping
   for multi-line fields. Guarded editing with ModifyPortalContent
   rather than the download permission.

 - Save adapter: stored records can now be edited through the Plone UI
   via the data saver's tabular view.
   The edit UI is pretty basic and provides only a text field per
   stored value. No fancy widgets, no validation.
   (Andreas Jung)

1.2.3
-----

 - Created egg framework, moved svn trunk to
   collective/Products.PloneFormGen/trunk.

 - Some change around Plone 3.1 caused a problem where minor version
   updates of PFG would cause the formgen_tool to be created inside the
   portal_quickinstaller, thoroughly fouling it up. Yuck. Fixed.
   (Tracker #205; Thanks, Wouter Vanden Hove)

1.2.2
-----

 - The PicklistWidget used to pick ThanksPage fields doesn't respect the
   order of the value it's supplied, so let's always sort the values
   into the same order as the form. (Thanks, Lucia Colombo)

 - Adapt more public page templates to have Plone 3+ -specific versions.
   (Tracker: 189; Thanks, Max Bloechle)

 - Mailer "None" radio button choices for to_field and replyto_field
   should be selected when appropriate. (Tracker 190)

 - Hide useless "properties" and "references" tabs in Plone 3+.
   (Thanks, ddurham)

 - Added 'Contributor' to default roles allowed to create Form Folders.
   (Tracker #199; thanks, Marc Nieper-Wißkirchen)

 - Values in password fields were being lost whenever a form didn't
   validate. While this might make sense in other contexts, it doesn't
   match the common use case in PFG. Fixed. (Tracker #200)

 - Mailer body prepend and append fields were showing unnecessary
   and misleading text format selection boxes. (Tracker #185; Same
   problem as #173)

1.2.1
-----

 - Using non-ascii chars in the title of a required field would provoke a
   UnicodeDecodeError on failed validation. Fixed. (Tracker #174; Thanks,
   Daniel Kraft)

 - In a Plone 3 site that has Kupu's UID Linking and/or Image Captioning
   features enabled, PFG textarea fields show a format select field and
   cause server crashes. Fixed. (Tracker 173; Thanks John Stahl and Jon
   Baldivieso)

1.2.0
-----

 - Fixes in nl translation. (Tracker 166: Radek Jankiewicz)

 - Remove obsolete migration from PFGDataGrid. (Tracker 169: Thanks, Zippy)

1.2-RC2
-------

 - Dramatically simplify schema for most components by hiding most
   metadata fields in Plone 3. (Tracker 161; Thanks, Jon Stahl)

 - Empty, hidden lines field caused error on form display. Fixed.
   (Tracker #151)

1.2-RC1
-------

 - Improve error message on mail attempt when no recipient address is
   found and form owner has no e-mail address. Also, make it less likely
   by using portal email_from_address as a fallback. (Tracker #140,
   thanks Andreas Jung)

1.2-Beta-6
----------

 - Mailer was having problems with i18n characters in fields in Plone 3+.
   Fixed. (Tracker #144, thanks Anders Avlesen)

 - Manually editing saved data (in a save data adapter) was not working
   since storage change in 1.2 beta 1. Fixed. (Tracker #145)

 - Fixed: Exception when submitting a form with a text field that
   exceeds the "Max Length" character limit. (Tracker #142)

1.2-Beta-5
----------

 - Thanks page editing was having kupu problems in Plone 3 for fields off the
   default schema. So, when running Plone 3.0, pack them on the default schema.
   This also brings the schema count down to 5, to avoid schema selection widget.
   Not ideal, but it's working.

 - When a form date field was not required, it was possible to enter invalid
   dates. Added a special validator that should cause a validation error when
   a bad date is actually entered, but not if the month or year is left as
   "--" (Tracker #132)

 - Added README_PLONE3.txt to document workaround for permissions problem
   using selection and multi-selection form fields in Plone 3.0 (fixed in 3.0.1).
   (Tracker #136)

 - There was no status message when validation failed in Plone 3. Fixed.
   (Tracker #133, thanks Lucie Lejard)

 - Validation script was discarding any errors that might already be in the
   CMFFormController state. Fixed. (Tracker #134, thanks Lucie Lejard)

 - Fields in fieldsets were not being offered as options in the mailer's extract
   recipient and extract replyto options. Fixed. (Tracker #123, thanks Marie
   Robichon)

 - The validation message rewriter for Plone 2.1 was broken, resulting in an
   error whenever a form wouldn't validate. Fixed. (Tracker #124, thanks Aleksandr
   Vladimirskiy)

1.2-Beta-4
----------

 - In Plone 3, Kupu has started saving "<p>&nbsp;</p>" for empty inputs. This
   forced white space into the the form if prologue and/or epilogue were empty.
   Fixed with custom mutators. (Tracker #120, thanks Michael Dunlap)

 - Check ids of fields to make sure they don't collide with known
   troublesome ids ('zip', 'location', 'language'). Also prevent use of
   ids that duplicate those in fieldset folders. (Tracker #94, thanks Gregory
   Hnatiuk; Tracker #107, thanks Kim Nielsen)

 - Turn off KSS blur event handling for rendered forms in Plone 3. Maybe
   we'll be able to implement in-line validation later.

 - Bring Plone 3 macro versions into line with Archetypes 1.5.

 - Remove several workarounds for Archetypes 1.5 beta bugs that were fixed in
   RC3.

 - Partial date entries to a Date/Time Field would raise a DateError exception.
   Fixed. (Tracker #118)

 - New Czech translation of plone-ploneformgen domain. Thanks, Jan Pokorny.

 - Updated Dutch translations, thanks to: markvl, justi and jladage and
   initial translations by Atopia.

1.2-Beta-3
----------

 - The 1.2-Beta-2 customizable string validators change introduced a problem
   that caused an error if a string field had no validator. Fixed.

 - Add ability to set display strings for boolean field checked and unchecked.
   These are used in the thanks page and mailer in place of '0' and '1'. (Tracker
   #112)

1.2-Beta-2
----------

 - Changed "Cancel" button to act as a reset button on rendered forms. It really
   has no other imaginable purpose. Change default to hide this nearly useless
   artifact. Add option to set button label.

 - Added start, end and future year options to DateTime Field. (Tracker #65,
   Thanks to Paul Eipper for the suggestion and Jeremy Keiper for the patch.)

 - Added new French message translations. Thanks, Gaël Le Mignot.

 - Add override to selectively enable/disable fields. Disabling a field removes
   it from the rendered field list. It will not appear in the form and will not be
   validated.

 - Add facility for customizable string validators and messages for use with the
   FormStringField. Currently, customization is via the config.py file. I may
   eventually figure out a way to get this into the configlet.

 - Add a content override for the RichLabelField.

 - If "PloneFormGen" was missing from any skin layer sets, uninstall or
   reinstall would fail. Fixed. (Tracker #109, Thanks: Yuri)

1.2-Beta-1
----------

 - Eradicate use of context['global_vars'], which is not supported in
   Plone 3. All tests now pass in Plone 3b3 (with patched Archetypes, see
   http://dev.plone.org/archetypes/ticket/724).

 - Extended characters in field title or description would provoke
   unicode cannot decode error. This occurs on indexing the field, and may
   be an Archetypes problem. Since there's no good reason to have these
   searchable, fixed by setting searchable false for field titles and
   descriptions. (Tracker # 102 and 104, Thanks: Petrus Wang)

 - Added Italian translation for Plone domain (add-item menu, schema
   names and such). Thanks to Carrer Yuri.

 - It's now possible to specify multiple e-mail recipients for the TO
   field via either the recipient override or using a multi-select field.
   (Tracker #59, Thanks, Edouard Mercier)

 - Fixed-point field minimum-value field changed from required to
   not-required. Requiring it made it impossible to set 0 for a minimum
   value. (Tracker #98, Thanks: Jeremy Keiper)

 - Added specialValidator method to BaseFormField to give form fields a
   way to do a more sophisticated validation than what's allowed by
   Archetypes-style validators.

 - Changed underlying storage mechanism for save-data adapter to use an
   IOBTree rather than Archetypes lines field storage (a sequence).
   This should cure a problem with data object size growing geometrically
   with new inputs (Tracker #81, thanks Jean-Paul Ladage).

   Existing save data adapters will be migrated when first touched by the new PFG
   version.

   This is NOT backwards compatible! So, you will not be able to save data
   in 1.2 and revert to 1.1.

 - Change default download format of new save-data adapters to csv.

 - Move 1.1.1 to branches/1.1. SVN trunk is now 1.2.

1.1.1
-----

 - The "strip trailing white space" fix in 1.1 handled the issue for
   validation, but the unchanged field was still processed and
   mailed/saved. Fixed.

 - Fixed a bug introduced by "strip trailing white space" fix in 1.1 that
   would cause a name error when validating an individual field (not a form).

 - When htmlValue for Selection and Multi-Selection fields doesn't find
   the submitted value in the field vocabulary, it should go ahead and
   return what was submitted. (Thanks, lzdych for a code fix)

 - Use the portal_transforms text_to_html transform to convert
   multi-line text field inputs to html. This will convert eols to breaks
   rather than collapsing lines. (Thanks: Darrick Servis)

 - Minor i18n fixups.

1.1
---

 - The mail adapter was truncating subject lines longer than 76
   characters due to a bad interaction between security testing and header
   encoding. Fixed. (Tracker #84, thanks to Mike Sassak for a great bug
   report)

 - Restore document actions to base view template. The reason for
   leaving them out probably wasn't as good as I thought when first
   excising them. (Tracker #86, thanks to Gregory Hnatiuk)

 - Strip trailing white space in all string-ish fields. Also, don't
   accept required fields when only white space is submitted. (Fixes
   Tracker #79: thanks Rene Pijlman)

 - For Selection or Multi-Selection form fields, no input could result
   in an error "AttributeError 'NoneType' object has no attribute
   'encode'". This was a bug in the display labels fix in RC3. Fixed.
   (Tracker #80, thanks Rene Pijlman)

 - The "Thanks Page" option in the form folder edit view would display
   python scripts and other non-Plone objects. Fixed. (Tracker #78, Thanks
   Marie Robichon)

1.1-RC3
-------

 - The creation of sample objects in initializeArchetypes left catalog
   orphans for the portal_factory objects.Solve the problem by removing
   them from the portal_catalog and uid_catalog, hopefully not causing
   other problems in the process. (Tracker #74, Thanks Jeremy Keiper)

 - Made the thanks-page and mailer display labels for selection and
   multi-selection fields rather than the values. (Tracker #71; thanks to
   Radim Novotny for diagnosis and patch.)


1.1-RC2
-------

 - Added localized time support for display (thanks page and mailer)
   renderings from Date-Time Field. (Tracker #71, thanks, Sufyan Patel)

 - Removed the "hidden" option from most fields. Archetypes support for
   it was uneven and not really necessary for anything more than strings,
   lines and text. So, why not get it out of the way? (Tracker #69, thanks
   to Radim Novotny for pointing out the problem.)

 - Added optional tabular and record supplemental views for save data
   adapter.

 - Added convenience method 'getColumnTitles' to saver.

1.1-RC1
-------

 - File fields would not show up on the thanks page, and their column
   names would be omitted from saver data. Fixed.

 - CustomScriptAdapter 'fields' parameter was mis-identified as 'results' in
   sample comment documentation. Fixed. (Thanks, Brook Milligan)

 - Made the success action given to CFMFormController always be
   "traverse_to". The form previously would traverse to objects
   implementing IPloneFormGenThanksPage, but redirect to other pages or
   templates. While there might be reasons to do this, they're overwhelmed
   by the puzzle this might pose for the user trying to figure out why
   request was available for one type and not another. Note that this does
   not apply to overrides, where the action type must always be specified.

 - Custom validators for File Fields always received None as "value"
   parameter due to the fact that the file widget appends _file to the
   input name. Fixed. (Tracker #64; Thanks, Kiran Jonnalagadda for a
   diagnosis and patch.)

1.1-Beta-4
----------

 - Attempts to use acquired scripts in form setup and after validation
   overrides of form would provoke an AttributeError. Scripts inside the
   form folder worked. This was due to an unfortunate choice of workaround
   for expression context poisoning: aq_explicit was being used for the
   context. Added a cleanExpressionContext routine to clean the expression
   context instead by deleting the cache for the object context after calling
   a TALES expression. That allowed fixing the context to allow acquisition.
   (Tracker #62)

 - Added convenience method InputAsDictionaries to save-data adapter.
   Returns saved data as list of dictionaries with column keys.

 - fgGetSuccessAction was unnecessarily causing a traverse from the Zope
   root. This was a problem if any parent of the form was private. Fixed.
   (Tracker #60; Thanks Marcel)

 - Downloading data from the save data adapter would provoke a Unicode
   exception if data included non-ASCII, 'use column names' was in effect,
   and one of the preset extra data choices was checked. Fixed. (Tracker
   #55)

 - DataGridField example: DGF field wasn't being added to fieldset
   allowed types. Fixed. (Tracker #61, thanks, Paul Eipper)

 - Added explicit, empty .po files for English to (hopefully) resolve
   tracker #56 (thanks, Christof Haemmerle and sydw (#plone).

1.1-Beta-3
----------

 - Added Polish (PL) translation donated by Lukasz Lichota. Fixed up a
   couple of duplicate msgids revealed by the new translation files.

 - More uninstall cleanup. On uninstall, remove FormFolder and
   FieldsetFolder from siteProperties use_folder_tabs and
   typesLinkToFolderContentsInFC. (Tracker #57, thanks DigitalD)

 - The validation message cleanup routine introduced in 1.1 beta 1 would
   fail with a message "TypeError: cleanupMessage() takes exactly 1
   argument (2 given)" under Plone < 2.5. Fixed.

 - Added class selector to div surrounding form to facilitate CSS
   decoration. (Tracker #46, Thanks Steve Rauch)

 - When possible, get guess_content_type from zope.app.content_types
   rather than OFS.content_types. Now no deprecation errors in 2.5.2 RC 1.

 - A KeyError exception in an action adapter would be swallowed by a too
   extensive try/except. Fixed. (Tracker #54, thanks, Maurits van Rees)

 - Added an example of adding a new widget to PFG from another product.
   Copy PFGDataGrid from the examples directory to Products/ to activate a
   DataGridField form field.

 - Using an after-validation override was clobbering the expression
   context, causing an error if we ended up traversing to a template.
   Fixed.

 - On uninstall, remove 'PloneFormGen' layer from all skin selections.

1.1-Beta-2
----------

 - Added "Execution Condition" override to action adapters. This allows
   conditional execution of action adapters depending on form input.

 - Atopia <info@atopia.nl> has contributed a Dutch translation. Thanks!

 - Simon Käser has contributed a German translation. Thanks!

1.1-Beta-1
----------

 - Added a rudimentary facility to return better alternatives to the
   Archetypes validation messages. These should also be translatable. This
   will probably need refinement. Ideally, we'll abandon it when this gets
   straightened out in Archetypes. Thanks to Matej Baric (#plone mte) for
   pressing me on the need for this.

 - The thanks page option to ignore empty fields wasn't working. Fixed.

 - Workaround what I consider a Zope marshalling error: the production
   of lists like ['one', ''] and [''] for list fields. PFG will now pop
   list results if the last item is an empty string. This is done before
   validation.

 - Made installation add FormFolder to default_page_types. (Tracker #49:
   Thanks, Jon Stahl)

1.1-Alpha-4
-----------

 - Fixed bad interaction between Thanks Pages and fieldsets. (Tracker
   #44, Thanks: David Sandy)

 - Attempted to exterminate all the cases where PFG tests to see if a
   field is a label or file field by checking the meta_type. Replaced with
   tests of isLabel or isFileField methods. This is a first step towards
   making it easier to add support for new field types.

1.1-Alpha-3
-----------

 - Added "Fieldset Folder", which puts its enclosed fields into an XHTML
   fieldset with an optional legend. (Feature Enhancement Proposal #2,
   thanks Michael Dunlap)

 - Added TALES overrides for subject, sender and recipient to the
   mailer. (Tracker #43, thanks: Pierre-Yves Landure)

 - Fix for Tracker #42 -  Editing Short Names Has No Effect. (Thanks:
   Kevin Strasser)

1.1-Alpha-2
-----------

 - Added default mail addressing setup to configlet.

 - Added default mail template setup to configlet.

 - Activate action adapters on creation to save confusion.

 - Set up a portal_properties property sheet for site configuration
   persistence.

1.1-Alpha-1
-----------

 - Added a configlet to control association of roles and PFG permissions
   at the portal root. (This completes Feature Enhancement Proposal #3,
   thanks Joel Burton)

 - Moved recipient fields of mail adapter to default schema. They're the
   most likely to be customized.

 - Added specific permissions for advanced and encryption-related
   fields. We'll use these to hide the fields from roles that needn't see
   them.

 - Add framework to allow different add permissions for different content
   types. Set individual add permission for Custom Script Adapter.

 - Mailer wasn't picking up owner e-mail address unless owner is a manager.
   Fixed.

 - Removing an active action adapter would result in a KeyError on form
   submit. Fixed. The missing adapter will now be ignored.

 - Added "Custom Script Adapter" by Mikko Ohtamaa (#plone: Moo). This is
   an action adapter that makes it easy to script success actions without
   having to use the ZMI to add/manipulate a python script. Note:
   PythonField (from the ScriptableFields bundle) is now required.

 - Change configure.zcml.plone25 to be configure.zcml. Users of Plone
   2.1.x will need to delete or rename this file to avoid errors (unless
   they have independently updated Five).

1.0.1
-----

 - The memberEmail and memberFullName methods (convenience methods for
   use in defaults) were only working for managers. Fixed. (Tracker #39,
   thanks: Jacob Nordfalk)

 - Using the "Form Setup Script" override in Plone 2.5.1 would cause a
   misleading "NameError: name 'checkPermission' is not defined" error on
   form display. Evaluation of the TALESField was clobbering the request's
   expression context. Fixed. (Tracker #37, thanks: Andreas Jung)

 - Mailer was using MIMEMultipart even when there were no attachments.
   Fixed. (tracker #36, thanks: Igor Stroh)

1.0
---

 - Set default maxlength for textarea form field to 0 to work around the
   Archetypes 1.4.1 "characters remaining" bug
   <http://dev.plone.org/archetypes/ticket/691>.

 - Added option to get column names as a first line in input downloaded
   from save adapter. (thanks: Servilio Afre Puentes)

 - International characters in a field title could cause a unicode
   decode error in the mail adapter's addressing schema. Fixed. (tracker
   #35, thanks: Pierre-Yves Landure)

 - Creating a form field with an ID of 'language' would cause a nasty,
   hard-to-debug problem with PTS. PFG will now raise a BadRequest
   exception if the user tries to injure themselves this way. (tracker
   #32, thanks, Rocky Burt)

 - Fixed a problem with the MaxLengthValidator where sometimes an unset
   (by the user) widget.maxlength actually has an empty string as the
   value which would make the int(widget.maxlength) call fail (Rocky
   Burt).

 - The mailer was including rich-text labels in mailed results;
   save-data adapter was including rich-text and plain labels. Fixed.
   (Tracker #31, thanks: jim sfba)

1.0-RC2
-------

 - Made PATH_INFO a default member of the x-info headers for mailer.

 - Tightened field read permissions (from View to ModifyPortalContent)
   on mailer to prevent the view method from disclosing its settings.

 - Added rich text label (tracker #28, thanks: Pierre-Yves Landure)

 - Added .mo files for existing translations in locales/.

1.0-RC1
-------

 - More i18n fixes from Pierre-Yves Landure (tracker #24).

 - Added functional tests for mailer, saver and fgValidate.

 - Allow multiple live action adapters. (tracker #12)

1.0-beta6
---------

 - Added marker interface for thanks pages to make it easier to
   use a derived content type for that purpose. (Thanks: Emyr Thomas)

 - Added After Validation override to form folder.

 - Added header injection override to form folder.

 i18n work by Pierre-Yves Landure:

 - Added a better localisation support, compatible with Five and Zope 3.

 - Corrected an i18n bug in Mailer Adapter

 - Completed french translation

1.0-beta5
---------

 - Switch version numbering to match the release mangement process of
   PloneSoftwareCenter.

 - Added uninstall code that cleans up most of what the install routine
   does.

 - Added to thanks page the ability to display a different message
   when there's no form submit. (tracker #15; thanks: Emyr Thomas)

0.4.0
-----

 - Made it easy (too easy?) to clear input saved in save
   data adapter.

 - Rich text field now has control over use of HTMLTidy. Only
   appears if HTMLTidy is available.

 - Added a "Form Setup Script" option to the form override fieldset.
   This is meant to allow for a script to set up multiple field defaults.

 - Activated encryption for mail adapter. Note that the encryption
   field set will not display unless gpg is available.

0.3.0
-----

 - Added convenience methods for use in default overrides
   to get member data: memberFullName, memberEmail, memberId.
   This is a partial solution to tracker #10 (thanks, Norbert Klamann).
   Made sample form replyto use here/memberEmail

 - Fixed problem with Plone 2.5 that prevented use of
   custom defaults and validators in field preview context.
   For those who are interested, it turns out that tales
   expression evaluation caches contexts, so its necessary
   to set the object context carefully to avoid sabotaging
   other tales evaluations.

 - Make a blank custom validator act as if python:False

 - Make field custom validators a bit easier to use by
   having a 'value' variable available. Asking
   folks to handle the request may be a bit much.

 - Custom field validators weren't working a form context. Fixed.

 - Added form action override. (tracker #6, thanks: Michael Dunlap)

 - Lots of i18n machinery fixes, including for vocabularies for
   selection and multi-selection widgets. Generated first .pot file.

0.2.0
-----

 - Added 'thanks page' content type that's smart enough to display select
   field input. (tracker #3, thanks: Kim Nielsen)

 - CSV download option for save adapter. (tracker #1, thanks: Jon Stahl)

 - Mailer will now throw an assertion exception if there is no specified
   recipient e-mail address and the owner doesn't have an address. This
   is rude, but better than an unintelligible traceback due to an SMTP error.
