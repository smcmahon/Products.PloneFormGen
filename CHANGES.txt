Change History
==============

1.8.9 (2021-05-27)
------------------

- Fixed incompatibility with Products.PloneHotfix20210518.
  [dhavlik, spereverde, maurits]


1.8.8 (2020-11-16)
------------------

- Fixed portal_skins directory path on Plone 5.2
  It was ``PloneFormGen/skins/PloneFormGen`` but now has to be ``Products.PloneFormGen:skins/PloneFormGen``.
  This might need an upgrade step, but you can also do this manually in portal_skins in the ZMI.
  Note that PloneFormGen is not really tested on Plone 5.2.
  In fact the automatic tests completely fail on 5.2, so use at your own risk.

  [maurits]

  Do not use ``plone_utils.getSiteEncoding()``, because this is

  [maurits]

- Load widget specific css on quickedit form.
  [maurits]

- Fix embedded view by removing deprecated global defines macro.
  [buchi]

- Removed inline javascript that tried to block inline validation.  It
  had no effect anymore on Plone 5, as no inline validation is done

  the bottom instead of in the head.
  [maurits]
