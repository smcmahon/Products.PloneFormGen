1.8.0 (2015-10-01)
------------------

- Moved our default_page_types setting to the registry.
  [maurits]

- Get email settings from registry.  Fixes several Plone 5 errors.
  Do not use ``plone_utils.getSiteEncoding()``, because this is
  deprecated and always returns ``utf-8``.
  [maurits]

- Load widget specific css on quickedit form.
  [maurits]

- Fix embedded view by removing deprecated global defines macro.
  [buchi]

- Removed inline javascript that tried to block inline validation.  It
  had no effect anymore on Plone 5, as no inline validation is done
  here anyway.  And it interferes with themes that load jQuery near
  the bottom instead of in the head.
  [maurits]

--------------------
