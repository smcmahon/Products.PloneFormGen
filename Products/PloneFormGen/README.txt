1.7 Notes
=========

PFG 1.7 is intended for use with Plone 4.1+. If you're using Plone < 4.1, PFG 1.6
will be a better choice.

If upgrading from an earlier version, uninstall and reinstall PFG to add new
functionality.

Overview
========

This product provides a generic Plone form generator using fields,
widgets and validators from Archetypes. Use it to build simple,
one-of-a-kind, web forms that save or mail form input.

To build a web form, create a form folder, then add form fields as
contents. Individual fields can display and validate themselves for
testing purposes. The form folder creates a form from all the contained
field content objects.

Final disposition of form input is handled via plug-in action products.
Action adapters included with this release include a mailer, a
save-data adapter that saves input in tab-separated format for later
download, and a custom-script adapter that makes it possible to script
simple actions without recourse to the Zope Management Interface.

To make it easy to get started, newly created form folders are
pre-populated to act as a simple e-mail response form.

Dependencies
============

Plone: Plone 4.1+

Requires PythonField, TALESField and TemplateFields from Jens W.
Klein's ScriptableFields bundle: http://plone.org/products/scriptablefields/
(automatically loaded if you install via Python package).

Encryption of e-mail requires the Gnu Privacy Guard, GnuPG, also known
as gpg. See README_GPG.txt for details.

CAPTCHA support requires either collective.captcha or collective.recaptcha.
See README_CAPTCHA.txt for details.

Installation
============

Buildout
--------

*   Just add ``Products.PloneFormGen`` to the eggs section of your buildout
    configuration and run buildout.

*   Restart Zope.

*   Go to the Site Setup page in the Plone interface and click on the
    Add/Remove Products link. Choose PloneFormGen (check its checkbox) and
    click the Install button. If PloneFormGen is not available on the
    Add/Remove Products list, it usually means that the product did not
    load due to missing prerequisites.

*   If necessary, use the PloneFormGen configlet in the "Add-on Product
    Configuration" section of Site Setup to customize the product for your
    site.

Permissions
===========

Site managers may control the visibility and availability of many
PloneFormGen functions by changing permissions for user roles. A
control panel configlet controls role/permission associations for the
portal root. For an explanation of how PloneFormGen permissions map to
form folder and form field fields, see improvement proposal #3, Provide
ways to hide advanced options from classes of
users: http://plone.org/products/ploneformgen/roadmap/3 .

Security
========

As shipped, only managers may use TALES expressions to override
defaults and validators. You may wish to add additional roles, but keep
in mind that this is a potential security risk; it basically gives the
same powers as scripting or skin editing.

Javascript/CSS Support for Some Fields
======================================

Some fields, like the rich text editor and the calendar widget on the
date/time field require JS or CSS support that often is not loaded
for anonymous users. If you wish this support for anon users, you'll
need to remove the "not: portal/portal_membership/isAnonymousUser"
condition for their support code in portal_css and portal_javascripts.


Rationale For This Product
==========================

*   Plone needs a general-purpose form generator that may be used for
    mail forms, RDBMS database interactions and other functions that don't
    require the Archetypes' persistence machinery;

*   Designing a form using such a form generator should not require a)
    work on the file system, b) creation of new content types, c) use of
    the ZMI (except for scripting field population or custom validation).
    [PloneFormMailer is an outstanding, useful product, that suffers only
    for its reliance on the ZMI/Formulator for design.]

*   Archetypes, in conjunction with the CMF Form Controller, has a form
    generator built-in. Ideally, it should be possible to repurpose the
    Archetypes widgets and validators (which were evidently intended to be
    generally useful) for a more general-purpose form generator.

Credits
=======

Archetypes has been ruthlessly mined for concepts and functionality.
The base view and edit macro templates are very slightly modified
versions of Archetype's base_edit and edit_macros.

Form and field icons are scavenged from Martijn Faassen's Formulator,
and were edited only to add transparency to make them look a bit better
on the add items menu.

The mail adapter is basically a tailored version of PloneFormMailer,
minus the Formulator adapter machinery. Thanks to PloneFormMailer's
authors, Jens Klein and Reinout van Rees.

Pierre-Yves Landure provided tremendous help with the i18n machinery.
Sebastien Douche and Pierre-Yves Landure provided the French translation.

Martin Aspeli's RichDocument has provided an invaluable reference,
particularly in how to handle installation and testing issues.

Martin Aspeli, Wichert Akkerman, Eric Steele, Jens Klein and Reinout
van Rees all provided valuable early feedback.

Titus Anderson provided the base code for the Ratings-Scale Field.
Andreas Jung contributed the record-editing feature for the Save Data
adapter.

Fulvio Casali, Alex Tokar, David Glick, Steve McMahon, Jesse Snyder,
Michael Dunlap, Paul Bugni, Jon Baldivieso and Andrew Burkhalter all
did amazing things at the December 2008 PFG sprint sponsored by OneNW.
Special thanks to David, for the CAPTCHA work, and Andrew for export/
import.

Thomas Buchberger provided the initial CAPTCHA field implementation.

David Glick effectively has been co-maintainer for versions since
1.2.5. Thanks, David!

Nenad Mancevic (Manca) added the widget toolbox and dramatically enhanced
the quick edit mode for his Google Summer of Code 2010 project. Thanks to
Manca and Google!
